The situation is further complicated by the fact that
There seems to be evidence that
A general consensus is that
Pragmatically,
A basic methodological assumption of our work is that
Nevertheless,
Presumably,
The advantage is that
In some approaches to representation, 
In a similar vein, 
In other words, it is not necessarily the case that
On our assumptions,
It may be, then, that
It must be emphasized, once again, that
Interestingly enough,
It is interesting to note that
It seems plausible that
Let us continue to suppose that
Notice, incidentally, that
With this clarification,
We have already seen that
Let us continue to suppose that 
Summarizing, then, we assume that 
For one thing
This suggests that 
Suppose, for instance, that
From this it follows that
For any transformation which is sufficiently diversified in application to be of any interest, 
In the discussion of Chomskian hierarchies given above,
Quine's contention is that 
Before componential analysis emerged as a first concrete approach to describing word meaning (Trier 1931; Weisgerber 1951), 
Luria (e.g., Vinogradova and Luria 1961) showed through a series of experiments that
It was shown later by Katz and Fodor (1963) that
Unfortunately, as formal semanticists readily admit, 
In practice, 
In our view, Marr and Nishihara's theory predicts that
It may happen of course, that 
One bonus of this analysis is that
Within a declarative, predicate-based "logical" system,
We can only give a brief overview here, but it should be stressed that
It should not have escaped the reader's notice that
Extending the same approach to formal semantics, 
Without a prior formalization of mathematical proof, 
Strictly speaking
In this context, 
Since domain models are unambiguous,
The definition defined in Schmolze and Brachman 1982 (p11) obviously violates the plausible idea that
Given the aforementioned view of inference as refining and deepening the semantic representation, 
Although I have not worked out the exact mechanism here,
As was assumed in the original example,
In terms of our example, this means that
It is sufficient to note that 
Linguists have a tendency to describe language as a quasi-mathematical entity that can be studied without regard for its function as a communication device. However, 
However, if we were somewhat worried about the effects of the Schank's search technique in terms of search time,
